Future Enhancements
====================
Future enhancements to this project include:

1. Resolving the Base64 decoder error loop with AES256 Decryption to finalize the whole AES256 method and get it working.
2. Finding a way to store and read in secret keys so that DES and AES256 can function similarly to the Caesarean cipher where multiple files can be encrypted one after the other without having to immediately decrypt like in the initial version.
3. Include other methods like SHA256, Triple DES, Viginere, and others.
4. Include functionality to have a pop-out window to select files as an alternative to entering the file path. 
5. Overhaul into a JavaFx project to make a more interactive and appealing UI.

* Number 4 would require a JavaFx upgrade potentially*
