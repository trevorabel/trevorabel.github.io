## How to compiles / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

Use the built in run feature in Netbeans to run this program. 

## UI Design

The UI for this program is just the simple output frame from NetBeans that displays different references to a type of book after it is entered into the demo file. To test other books you must add the information into the demo page of the program just like the other book examples at the top of main.

Fig 3. This is the code for QtimeNote that takes the input from the user and stores users notes but also is what calls the qtime fuctions to compare or get references.

## 3. Additional Considerations

For easiest use when running this program use the coding program NetBeans. The project was created in NetBeans so it will be easy for it to adapt and run faster.
