I. Statement of Purpose
-----------------------
Encryption should bre a readily avaliable solution for all consumers not just businesses and government entities. However, consumer grade encryption is not readily available unless you are prepared to spend money to get it, in the digital age every person has a right to privacy and therefore should be entitled to ways to protect their privacy without having to spend money. In other words, encryption should be free and readily available to the general populous since we all have digital information or records that require protection of some sort. Additionally, we the consumers should be able to select the type of encryption that we want to use while some companies like Windows provide built in encryption for folders and files by checking a box it is set to one method. This is great because it provides a method of encryption for the general public to have access to without having to pay someone to do it. 

However, there is a downfall to this method, it is that if someone cracks one version of the encryption method it will be asier for them to crack another and then a hundred more after that. This is the limitaion of having a singular publically free encryption method. Also, the free encryption programs while beneficial for the average user they present a major risk for those users beause free software does not always put sevruity first when it comes to customer information and their companies products.

Everyone wants to find the best deal or get it for free when they can however, free software can pose extreme harm to you, your assets, or your company. This brings this to the forefront of what is important in today's world and socitey at an unprecedented time of techonlogical spread and digitizaiton, privacy is something that lately has not been as talked about. Now, with the rise of cyber attacks and security breaches the question of security of out personal and private information is finally coming to the forefront of discussion.

Personal data such as medical records, banking records, tax records, or other online records have immense value to the owner of those documents and if they are compromised it can lead to immense financial, reputational, emotional, or pyhsical harm to that individual. This is illustrated in a paper on the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity where they say, "Data is considered to be the gold of the digital age... Data has become an important commodity generating profits on its own;" this shows that there is not only value but power in our data [1]. Our data today has more value than our vehicles, houses, vacation homes, and even some of our bank accounts. The true price of someones private personal data is priceless because so much damage can be done to a person simply by taking some seemingly insignificant personal information. In an article in Forbes its says, "Of course, when you give multiple third parties access to yhour company's data, you increase the risk of that data being stolen or used in ways that don't benefit your organization." this is a very common saying but its one of the most truthful representations of security in the digital age [2]. Allowing access or connection between accounts provides great seamless use for many applications like facebook and spotify, you can use your facebook account to sign up for spotify however, it means that if spotify gets compromised your facebook credentials could also be compromised. It is estimated that we spend on average 6 hours and 42 minutes a day on the internet, which equates to almost 100 days a year, it is strikingly clear that nowadays we spend a monstrous amount of time online [3]. While we spend so much time online the other thing that is growning exponentially with the amount of time online is the number of sensitive documents that are uploaded, shared, downloaded, and stored online. This means that security of these documents and information is becoming a major concern. 


A solution to remedy this problem is to develop a widely spreadable localized encryption program. This program would function based of the machine its installed on using its components to generate all the necessary parts making them unique to the computer and creating this program allows for user customization to the actual program itself. Providing customization to the actual methodds of creation for the encryption can increase the difficulty of cracking one of these algorithms. Conversely it can make someone who is unfamiliar with secuirty, programming, or encryption a higher risk target than intended because they can make the algorithm weaker unknowingly. However, for the vast majority of the populous they stand to benefit from some form of free available customizable encryption software that they can use exclusively for their important documents.
