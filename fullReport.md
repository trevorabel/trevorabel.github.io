I. Statement of Purpose
-----------------------
Encryption should bre a readily avaliable solution for all consumers not just businesses and government entities. However, consumer grade encryption is not readily available unless you are prepared to spend money to get it, in the digital age every person has a right to privacy and therefore should be entitled to ways to protect their privacy without having to spend money. In other words, encryption should be free and readily available to the general populous since we all have digital information or records that require protection of some sort. Additionally, we the consumers should be able to select the type of encryption that we want to use while some companies like Windows provide built in encryption for folders and files by checking a box it is set to one method. This is great because it provides a method of encryption for the general public to have access to without having to pay someone to do it. 

However, there is a downfall to this method, it is that if someone cracks one version of the encryption method it will be asier for them to crack another and then a hundred more after that. This is the limitaion of having a singular publically free encryption method. Also, the free encryption programs while beneficial for the average user they present a major risk for those users beause free software does not always put sevruity first when it comes to customer information and their companies products.

Everyone wants to find the best deal or get it for free when they can however, free software can pose extreme harm to you, your assets, or your company. This brings this to the forefront of what is important in today's world and socitey at an unprecedented time of techonlogical spread and digitizaiton, privacy is something that lately has not been as talked about. Now, with the rise of cyber attacks and security breaches the question of security of out personal and private information is finally coming to the forefront of discussion.

Personal data such as medical records, banking records, tax records, or other online records have immense value to the owner of those documents and if they are compromised it can lead to immense financial, reputational, emotional, or pyhsical harm to that individual. This is illustrated in a paper on the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity where they say, "Data is considered to be the gold of the digital age... Data has become an important commodity generating profits on its own;" this shows that there is not only value but power in our data [1]. Our data today has more value than our vehicles, houses, vacation homes, and even some of our bank accounts. The true price of someones private personal data is priceless because so much damage can be done to a person simply by taking some seemingly insignificant personal information. In an article in Forbes its says, "Of course, when you give multiple third parties access to yhour company's data, you increase the risk of that data being stolen or used in ways that don't benefit your organization." this is a very common saying but its one of the most truthful representations of security in the digital age [2]. Allowing access or connection between accounts provides great seamless use for many applications like facebook and spotify, you can use your facebook account to sign up for spotify however, it means that if spotify gets compromised your facebook credentials could also be compromised. It is estimated that we spend on average 6 hours and 42 minutes a day on the internet, which equates to almost 100 days a year, it is strikingly clear that nowadays we spend a monstrous amount of time online [3]. While we spend so much time online the other thing that is growning exponentially with the amount of time online is the number of sensitive documents that are uploaded, shared, downloaded, and stored online. This means that security of these documents and information is becoming a major concern. 


A solution to remedy this problem is to develop a widely spreadable localized encryption program. This program would function based of the machine its installed on using its components to generate all the necessary parts making them unique to the computer and creating this program allows for user customization to the actual program itself. Providing customization to the actual methodds of creation for the encryption can increase the difficulty of cracking one of these algorithms. Conversely it can make someone who is unfamiliar with secuirty, programming, or encryption a higher risk target than intended because they can make the algorithm weaker unknowingly. However, for the vast majority of the populous they stand to benefit from some form of free available customizable encryption software that they can use exclusively for their important documents.

The benefits of this solution are that once the product is bug tested and operational there will be a free distributeable version of a customizable local encryption program. The program will be useful for those looking to take contents of a file and place them in a text file and be able to encrypt them so that only they are able to know the contents of that file. This adds a layer of protection to that file that contains personal information that could be used against them if someone were to get their hands on it. There are limitations to this program in its first version state like it can only be operated with .txt files so there are restrictions to its operation and its capabilities. However, this is still better than having no encryption on personal information files. Having even a small encryption on it provides time to react to secure information and change passwords that you would not get it there was no encryption at all on the files.

Creation of a free customizable encryption program for the general populous would educate the populous on the importance of data security but also provide them a way to act on the new information and take steps to protect their data. Then for those who are already educated on the subject matter it would provide them a local method of encryption that they can customize to increase their security on their personal information files or system. The alternatives of paying for this service mean that you get support for it and you get it sooner than a local program that you need to run however, the idea of security of personal information should not be something that the general populous has to pay for especially when the things at risk of unsecurred personal information is their livelihood and their financial, emotional, and physical well being.
  
II. Research & Background
-------------------------
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the need for end user encryption for their devices or files and that in the digital age this need is growing exponentially. The term End User Device is used to describe, "Any desktop or laptop computer, any tablet, smart phone, or other mobile device" as described by the University of Chicago and further mentions that USB drives or removable media does not count as an End User Device [4].NIST recognizes the need for storage security for individuals due to the precedent set by the security necessities set by the government with the following laws: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, OMB Memorandum M-06-16, Privacy Act of 1974, Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [5]. 
These federal laws and regulations set forth the precedent that for the protection and storage of personally identifiable data and health records. This set a standard for organiztations to follow but nothing for establishing a precedent for the importance of encryption for personal use. The lack of a precedent on the necessity for personal use encryption, a market opened for privitizing personal use encryption so those that wanted it had to pay for it.

The second major category of available pulic encryption is disk encryption. This is one of the more common forms of encryption for the average consumer who needs encryption. However, to do this typically it will require reformatting of a hard drive or solid state drive which most people would not do unless they have a brand new laptop or desktop. Additionally, there are some software that are not compatible with hard disk encryption. One of the most common applications for desktops, especially those built by teens and young adults, Steam, is not compatible with encrypted hard disks. Now modifications can be made to the application to allow for compatiblity but the average person is not proficient enough to make these changes.

In the present day, the value and focus of personal encryption is in health care encryption. While this is beneficial, this is also limiting to the utilization of personal use encryption. The benefit from this is that especially now in a global pandemic with COVID-19 we are able to hold virtual doctor's appointments and transmit medical records comfortably using encryption standards. However, there is no reason to stop at just medical records since nowadays any personal data has more value than most of our possesions.

In a paper published in 2005 titled, "New Methods in Hard Disk Encryption" it is stated that since our processors have become more powerful in the last decade that hard disk encryption has become more available to the public than it was previously. However, it also says that CBC is the most used cipher mode for hard disk encryption [6]. This is because the average consumer has no knowledge on how to alter the settings to their hard disk encryption method. This means that although each insance of hard disk encryption is separate they are using the same method which makes it less secure with each one before it that is broken. This can open many issues with security if it is something that can compromise individuals data by simply not giving them the option to choose their own encryption methods.

Sometimes full hard disk encryption is not even necessary or it is not feasible to make a backup and wipe the drive just to reformat it to an encrypted disk. In these instances where you just need one or more files encrypted but not everything else something like a program that encrypts files or file contents is much more beneficial to the average consumber. In this case my solution to this by creating a customizable encryption program would benefit this demographic of consumers.
