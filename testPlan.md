Test Plan
====================
The attached test plan covers the attempts made while testing the features of the File Encryptor project to get each part functional for testing.

Note: The AES256 Decryption method was stuck between 3 different errors dealing with Improper array length, Base64 decoder error, and invalid character errors. While debugging and resolving the invalid character errors a Base64 decoding error occurred. After debugging and resolving the Base64 error the Improper array length error occurred and in attempting to solve it ended back at the invalid character errors. Attempting to solve all three errors lead to a continuous loop of errors with no clear exit to a finished decryption method.

*See attached excel document for the Test Plan for the development of the senior project.*
