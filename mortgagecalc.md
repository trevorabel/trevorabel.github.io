## Project description

The Mortgage Calculator is a GUI based program that runs off of the codepen.io website. This program utilizes three coding languages HTML, CSS, and JS. The HTML provides the structure for the website based GUI telling it where each box, line of text, and button goes. The CSS provides the formatting of the text boxes, padding, text font, text location, and text color. The JS is the section of the code that handles all of the calculatiions with the given information to calculate the expected monthly mortgage payment based on the inital loan amount, the amount of time the loan is held for, and finally the interest rate of the loan.

## How to compiles / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
No Commands Needed To Compile
Just enter the values in the website GUI and 
press the calculate button for the program to work
```

## UI Design

The UI was design to be extremely simple so that it was easy to use and user friendly (figure 1). At its core the UI includes text boxes to input the three neccesary values. After entering the loan amout, the amount of time it is held for, and the interest rate all that you have to do is press estimate monthly payment. After pressing the estimate button it will proccess the information entered and plug it into the JS functions and return your estimated monthly payment in red text (figure 4).

## 3. Additional Considerations

You are welcome to download the attached files for the program as I have copied over their contents into seperate files for the HTML, CSS, and JS. However, please note that they are unlikely to work just by downloading them and will run the first time if you use the codepen.io website link that is provided in README.md file inside of the Mortgage Calculator folder in the private repository.
