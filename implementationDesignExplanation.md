Implementation Description & Explanaiton
====================

Introduction
------------
This project, the text file encryptor project, is a culmination of all the information that has been presented in the Computer Science classes offered at Charleston Southern for the Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security. The project is in fulfillment for the requirements of graduation and is focus of the senior project sequence where the Text File Encryptor was developed. This project, was designed, coded, tested, and completed within the sequence of the senior project classes starting at CSCI 496, Senior Project Design, and going through CSCI 499 Senior Project Defense. 

Goals & Objectives
------------------
For the implementation of the file encryptor project there are a few main goals. First, produce a fully working text file encryptor. Second, make this text file encryptor segmented in its respective areas so that the encryptor itself can be customized. Thirdly, have a working product that can be released for free to address the lack of free encryption choices for individual files and the lack of ability to choose the desired encryption method.
The objectives of this project include the following: develop a stronger understanding of Java-based security classes and structures, learn how to properly separate core functions of encryption from the rest of the program to create a program that is easier to modify, and produce a product that is a sufficient fullfilment of the senior project sequence for the requirements of graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security from Charleston Southern University.
