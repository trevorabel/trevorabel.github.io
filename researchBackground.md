Research & Background
====================
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the need for end user encryption for their devices or files and that in the digital age this need is growing exponentially. The term End User Device is used to describe, "Any desktop or laptop computer, any tablet, smart phone, or other mobile device" as described by the University of Chicago and further mentions that USB drives or removable media does not count as an End User Device [4].NIST recognizes the need for storage security for individuals due to the precedent set by the security necessities set by the government with the following laws: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, OMB Memorandum M-06-16, Privacy Act of 1974, Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [5]. 
These federal laws and regulations set forth the precedent that for the protection and storage of personally identifiable data and health records. This set a standard for organiztations to follow but nothing for establishing a precedent for the importance of encryption for personal use. The lack of a precedent on the necessity for personal use encryption, a market opened for privitizing personal use encryption so those that wanted it had to pay for it.

The second major category of available pulic encryption is disk encryption. This is one of the more common forms of encryption for the average consumer who needs encryption. However, to do this typically it will require reformatting of a hard drive or solid state drive which most people would not do unless they have a brand new laptop or desktop. Additionally, there are some software that are not compatible with hard disk encryption. One of the most common applications for desktops, especially those built by teens and young adults, Steam, is not compatible with encrypted hard disks. Now modifications can be made to the application to allow for compatiblity but the average person is not proficient enough to make these changes.

In the present day, the value and focus of personal encryption is in health care encryption. While this is beneficial, this is also limiting to the utilization of personal use encryption. The benefit from this is that especially now in a global pandemic with COVID-19 we are able to hold virtual doctor's appointments and transmit medical records comfortably using encryption standards. However, there is no reason to stop at just medical records since nowadays any personal data has more value than most of our possesions.

In a paper published in 2005 titled, "New Methods in Hard Disk Encryption" it is stated that since our processors have become more powerful in the last decade that hard disk encryption has become more available to the public than it was previously. However, it also says that CBC is the most used cipher mode for hard disk encryption [6]. This is because the average consumer has no knowledge on how to alter the settings to their hard disk encryption method. This means that although each insance of hard disk encryption is separate they are using the same method which makes it less secure with each one before it that is broken. This can open many issues with security if it is something that can compromise individuals data by simply not giving them the option to choose their own encryption methods.

Sometimes full hard disk encryption is not even necessary or it is not feasible to make a backup and wipe the drive just to reformat it to an encrypted disk. In these instances where you just need one or more files encrypted but not everything else something like a program that encrypts files or file contents is much more beneficial to the average consumber. In this case my solution to this by creating a customizable encryption program would benefit this demographic of consumers.
