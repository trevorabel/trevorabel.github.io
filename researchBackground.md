Research & Background
====================
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the need for end user encryption for their devices or files and that in the digital age this need is growing exponentially. The term End User Device is used to describe, "Any desktop or laptop computer, any tablet, smart phone, or other mobile device" as described by the University of Chicago and further mentions that USB drives or removable media does not count as an End User Device [4].NIST recognizes the need for storage security for individuals due to the precedent set by the security necessities set by the government with the following laws: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, OMB Memorandum M-06-16, Privacy Act of 1974, Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [5]. 
These federal laws and regulations set forth the precedent that for the protection and storage of personally identifiable data and health records. This set a standard for organiztations to follow but nothing for establishing a precedent for the importance of encryption for personal use. The lack of a precedent on the necessity for personal use encryption, a market opened for privitizing personal use encryption so those that wanted it had to pay for it.


In the present day, the value and focus of personal encryption is in health care encryption. While this is beneficial, this is also limiting to the utilization of personal use encryption. The benefit from this is that especially now in a global pandemic with COVID-19 we are able to hold virtual doctor's appointments and transmit medical records comfortably using encryption standards. However, there is no reason to stop at just medical records since nowadays any personal data has more value than most of our possesions.
